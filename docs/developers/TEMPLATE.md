# [Title of Implementation]

## Context and scope

[The goal is to bring up to speed some previous knowledge that can be helpful, including other design docs, links, etc. Keep it short.]

## Goals and Non-Goals

[Goals represent the desired outcomes that a system aims to achieve, while non-goals are potential objectives that are intentionally not pursued, even though they could be reasonably considered as goals. For instance, ACID compliance in a database could be classified as a non-goal; if opting for a solution that includes ACID compliance does not impede the primary goals, it might still be considered acceptable.]

## Design

[Start with an overview and then go into details. Depending on the task, also include: diagram, apis, data storage, pseudo code, trade-offs, potential security concerns or constraints.]

## Alternatives considered

[Optional. Document any other potential directions.]

## References

[Optional. Any external links that serve as support documentation.]
